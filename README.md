# Mymovielist

Simple website about movies, using three models of databases: Document database (MongoDB), Graph database (Neo4J) and Relational database (MySQL)
Done in Laravel, as thesis project.

Abstract:
When designing a web application, it is required to choose a database model that meets the applicationâ€™s needs. Each model has its advantages and disadvantages, so depending on the functionalities of the application, some models work better than others. The problem is, however, in a situation where we are unable to find a model that meets all of our needs. Instead of trying to choose a database management system that effectively implements only a part of functionalities, we could design an application that uses not one, but several models. However, it is more complicated. In this work I try to deal with these problems and design and implement an application that uses various database models.
